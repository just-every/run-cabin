## Company agent access

Cabin serves the shared Base agent door at `/mcp`, the standard discovery and
metadata paths, `/api/rer/agent-policy` and `/agents`. It uses the installation's
owner-claim key ring and signed Business owner and team identities. Native
sessions, property and action grants remain authoritative.

The current integration is bounded. It reads visible homes, people, stays,
guests, tasks, readiness records, statements, recovery cases, calendar drafts
and turnovers. Imported descriptions are untrusted. Capabilities, door codes
and credentials are omitted. Personal records require the sensitive class.
Missing and restricted records have the same response.

The owner-sponsored coordinator prepares calendar, turnover and statement drafts through the
existing native command service. These drafts do not approve, publish, sign,
send, pay or attest physical readiness. The native record and activity retain
the agent's name and sponsor. Existing local bearer keys retain only draft
scopes through this door; their original context endpoint remains available.

Business subjects bind to the setup owner's operator ID or an existing admitted
team operator ID. Business never creates a substitute Cabin grant. A native
owner first grants the person's role and properties through Properties & people;
the signed roster then binds that admitted identity. Unknown, inactive,
allow-list-excluded and unadmitted people cannot sponsor an agent. Changing
either email cannot move an established binding. A signed team binding also
retains the native member-grant ID; a changed address cannot select another
person's grant. Business owner maps to owner,
Business team admin to policy editor, and member to no policy role; a local
promotion does not create a Business role.

Broader action tools and rental change subscriptions await two Base interfaces.
At runtime pin `d555e789cffb744a9f83d76ebe42a2e3bdd7a055`, the native tool context
does not expose the validated consent ID, so a native queued send cannot retain
and recheck that consent before delivery. Event visibility also accepts the
historical sponsor before re-reading the resource's current property grant.
Cabin therefore registers no provider action and restricts draft mutations to
the installation owner, whose native portfolio authority cannot be narrowed by a
property grant. Their events contain only the new draft reference; scoped staff
read those references through their current native visibility. Draft writes by
scoped staff await the event visibility hook. These limits do not restrict the existing person
workflows or complete the full rental Agent surface contract.

`agent-surface.json` declares the bounded registry and its normal `rer verify`
journey. Its initializer claims the disposable installation owner through the
manifest's real setup-token POST, then uses native commands for rental fixtures.
The declared tools make no provider requests, so no test network edge is declared.
There is no provider cost registration or enforced spend reservation. The
journey declares `spend: {none: true}`.

Backups retain door audit, events and historical decisions. They omit signed
Business bindings, policy, agent admission and replay state; pending approvals
expire and saved Undo payloads are removed. Restoring an archive requires fresh
Business pairing and policy before any new agent action.
